# Yay, BTC!

I couldn't think of a better name...

### Where is it?

This application runs at https://yaybtc.herokuapp.com/

### Purpose

YAYBTC was planned and built in my spare time in a single month (April 2017). The purpose of the web app is to allow a user to sign up, send BTC to a wallet, and to turn auto-investing on or off. If auto-investing is turned on, an algorithm will decide whether or not to buy or sell a percentage of your Bitcoin.

**Note** to all randos that come across this and decide to try it out: this application is a big experiment and the algorithm that determines a buy or sell is not very sophisticated. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for lost or stolen Bitcoins or anything bad that happens to you as a result of your interactions with this site.
